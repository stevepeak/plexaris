## 2026-02-06 — Task 1: Database schema changes

Added `data jsonb` columns to `organization` and `product` tables for storing structured scraped data and scrape issues. Created new `file` table (id, organizationId, name, mimeType, size, content as bytea, createdAt) for storing uploaded documents. Created new `trigger_run` table (id, organizationId, triggerRunId, taskType, label, status, createdAt, updatedAt) for tracking active Trigger.dev runs per organization. Generated and applied migration `0012_nervous_avengers.sql`. Typecheck and lint pass.

**Files changed:**

- `packages/db/src/org-schema.ts` — added `data jsonb` column
- `packages/db/src/product-schema.ts` — added `data jsonb` column
- `packages/db/src/file-schema.ts` — new file table with bytea content
- `packages/db/src/trigger-run-schema.ts` — new trigger run tracking table
- `packages/db/src/schema.ts` — added barrel exports for new schemas
- `packages/db/migrations/0012_nervous_avengers.sql` — migration

## 2026-02-06 — Task 2: Move Zod schemas into packages/db

Moved all Zod validation schemas from `docs/schema.ts` into `packages/db/src/data-schemas.ts`. Removed `orderSchema` (out of scope per plan). Added `scrapeIssueSchema` for tracking validation failures during scraping. Created combined data schemas (`horecaDataSchema`, `supplierDataSchema`, `productDataSchema`) that wrap the entity schemas with a `scrapeIssues` array. Added `zod` as a dependency to `packages/db`. Exported everything from the barrel file. Deleted the original `docs/schema.ts`. All CI checks pass (typecheck, lint, knip, build).

**Files changed:**

- `packages/db/src/data-schemas.ts` — new, moved from `docs/schema.ts` with scrapeIssueSchema and combined data schemas
- `packages/db/src/schema.ts` — added barrel export for data-schemas
- `packages/db/package.json` — added `zod` dependency
- `bun.lock` — updated lockfile with zod for packages/db
- `docs/schema.ts` — deleted (moved to packages/db)

## 2026-02-06 — Task 3: Onboarding flow — Add URL and file upload steps

Expanded the onboarding flow from 2 steps (Type → Name) to 4 steps (Type → Name → URLs → Files). Created `UrlStep` component with a textarea for entering website URLs (one per line), with a dynamic "Skip"/"Continue" button. Created `FileUploadStep` component with drag-and-drop file upload area, file list with remove buttons, 5MB per-file size enforcement, and the final "Create organization" submit button. Updated `OrgNameStep` to show "Continue" instead of "Create organization" since submission now happens on step 4. Added file upload API route at `POST /api/organizations/[id]/files` that stores files as bytea in the `file` table. Updated the organization creation route to accept and store URLs in the `data` jsonb column. Created Storybook stories for both new components. All CI checks pass (typecheck, lint, knip, build).

**Files changed:**

- `apps/web/components/onboarding/types.ts` — added `urls` and `files` steps to `getSteps()`
- `apps/web/components/onboarding/url-step.tsx` — new URL input step component
- `apps/web/components/onboarding/url-step.stories.tsx` — new Storybook stories
- `apps/web/components/onboarding/file-upload-step.tsx` — new file upload step component
- `apps/web/components/onboarding/file-upload-step.stories.tsx` — new Storybook stories
- `apps/web/components/onboarding/org-name-step.tsx` — simplified to "Continue" button
- `apps/web/components/onboarding/org-name-step.stories.tsx` — updated for new props
- `apps/web/app/(app)/onboarding/page.tsx` — wired up all 4 steps with URLs and file upload
- `apps/web/app/api/organizations/route.ts` — accepts and stores URLs in data jsonb
- `apps/web/app/api/organizations/[id]/files/route.ts` — new file upload endpoint

## 2026-02-06 — Task 4: Active tasks card + scrape issues on organization page

Added an "Active Tasks" card and "Scrape Issues" table to the organization page. Created a new tRPC router (`triggerRunRouter`) with a `list` query that fetches running `trigger_run` rows for an org and retrieves fresh `publicAccessToken` from the Trigger.dev API server-side. The `ActiveTasksCard` component polls for active runs every 5 seconds and renders each run with a live streaming log line via the existing `useTriggerRun` hook, with status indicators (spinner/check/x). The card hides when there are no active runs. The `ScrapeIssuesTable` component displays scrape issues from the org's `data` jsonb column in a table with Source, Field, Raw Value, and Error columns; it hides when the array is empty. Both components have Storybook stories using static variants that avoid server-side dependencies. All CI checks pass (typecheck, lint, knip, build).

**Files changed:**

- `packages/api/src/routers/trigger-run.ts` — new tRPC router for active trigger runs
- `packages/api/src/index.ts` — added `triggerRun` router to appRouter
- `apps/web/components/active-tasks-card.tsx` — new ActiveTasksCard component (tRPC + live streaming)
- `apps/web/components/active-tasks-card-static.tsx` — static variant for Storybook
- `apps/web/components/active-tasks-card.stories.tsx` — Storybook stories
- `apps/web/components/active-task-row.tsx` — individual task row with useTriggerRun hook
- `apps/web/components/scrape-issues-table.tsx` — reusable scrape issues table component
- `apps/web/components/scrape-issues-table.stories.tsx` — Storybook stories
- `apps/web/app/(app)/orgs/[orgId]/page.tsx` — wired in ActiveTasksCard and ScrapeIssuesTable

## 2026-02-06 — Task 5: Trigger.dev agent workflows

Created three agent workflows for scraping organization and product data. Built two AI agent tools (`readFile` for reading uploaded files from the database, `queryDatabase` for CRUD operations on organizations and products) in `packages/agents/src/tools/`. Created the `scrapeOrganizationAgent` which navigates URLs with browserbase tools, reads uploaded files, extracts company/contact/delivery data against the horecaSchema or supplierSchema, stores results in the organization's `data` jsonb column, records scrape issues, and discovers product listings to spawn sub-tasks. Created the `scrapeProductAgent` which scrapes individual product pages, deduplicates by article number or GTIN/EAN, and upserts into the product table. Both agents use the AI SDK v5 `Experimental_Agent` class with browserbase, readFile, and queryDatabase tools. Created corresponding Trigger.dev tasks (`scrape-organization` and `scrape-product`) that manage `trigger_run` rows for live progress tracking, initialize browser sessions via a new `createBrowserSession` helper in the browserbase package, and handle error/completion status updates. All CI checks pass (typecheck, lint, knip, build).

**Files changed:**

- `packages/agents/src/tools/read-file.ts` — new tool for reading uploaded files from the file table
- `packages/agents/src/tools/query-database.ts` — new tool for database CRUD operations on orgs and products
- `packages/agents/src/scrape-organization-agent.ts` — new agent for scraping organization data from URLs and files
- `packages/agents/src/scrape-product-agent.ts` — new agent for scraping and deduplicating product data
- `packages/agents/src/index.ts` — added barrel exports for new agents and tools
- `packages/agents/package.json` — added `@app/db` dependency
- `packages/browserbase/src/session.ts` — new helper to create browser sessions without importing Stagehand directly
- `packages/browserbase/src/index.ts` — added barrel export for session helper
- `apps/trigger/src/tasks/scrape-organization.ts` — new Trigger.dev task for org scraping workflow
- `apps/trigger/src/tasks/scrape-product.ts` — new Trigger.dev task for product scraping workflow
- `apps/trigger/src/index.ts` — added exports for new tasks
- `apps/trigger/package.json` — added `@app/browserbase` dependency

## 2026-02-06 — Task 6: Wire it all together

Wired the onboarding flow to the scraping workflow and the org page. Added a `scrapeOrganization` tRPC mutation to the trigger router that fetches the org's URLs and file IDs from the database, triggers the `scrape-organization` Trigger.dev task, and inserts a `trigger_run` row using the actual Trigger.dev run ID so the active tasks card picks it up immediately. Updated the onboarding submit handler to call this mutation after org creation and file upload (non-blocking — if the trigger fails, the org is still created and the user is redirected). Updated the `scrape-organization` and `scrape-product` Trigger.dev tasks to use `ctx.run.id` instead of generating synthetic run IDs, and the org task now checks for an existing `trigger_run` row before inserting (to avoid duplicates since the tRPC mutation inserts first). The full flow: onboarding creates org → uploads files → triggers scrape → redirects to org page → active tasks card shows running agents → scrape issues appear when complete. All CI checks pass (typecheck, lint, knip, build).

**Files changed:**

- `packages/api/src/index.ts` — added `scrapeOrganization` tRPC mutation to trigger router
- `apps/web/app/(app)/onboarding/page.tsx` — wired submit to call scrapeOrganization mutation before redirect
- `apps/trigger/src/tasks/scrape-organization.ts` — use `ctx.run.id`, check for existing trigger_run row
- `apps/trigger/src/tasks/scrape-product.ts` — use `ctx.run.id` for trigger_run tracking
